# Alternative Solution to 13252A

This solution uses math instead of strings to process the integers and only requires one pass to figure out the terms. The loop revolves around the following equation:

_c_ = (_n_ mod 10^_i_) / 10^(_i_ - 1)

where _n_ is the number being tested and _i_ is which digit you wish to extract. _i_ ranges from 1, 2, ..., _j_, where _n_ is known to be a number with _j_ digits. The advantage of using this bit of mathematics is you can directly get the integer without string conversion and directly find the non zero terms without a second pass.
